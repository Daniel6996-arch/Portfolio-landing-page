            <h1>About Daniel Nyutu</h1>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>I started as a pupil in one of the public schools in the outskirts of Kabete. Despite the school being a fair performer in the National Exams, I did my best and got admitted into a National Secondary School where I pushed my studies and got a good grade at the end of my four years. Now I am a student at Moringa School.</p>
            <h4>Employment</h4>
            <p>I had landed on many errand jobs since completing my high school since I could not go on with studies due to financial constraints.</p>
            <h4>Why I pursue Programming</h4>
            <p>Since I was a small kid I was always fascinated by computers and how they worked. That is why when I came about this opportunity to study at Moringa School, I never hesitated. I also believe that software development is key when it comes to marketable careers now and in the future.</p>
            <h4>Hobbies/Interests</h4>
            <p>When I am not busy with work or school, I enjoy:- <ul type="none">
              <li>Biking Riding</li>
              <li>Mountain Hiking</li>
              <li>Nature Walking</li>
            </ul></p>
